Description
======
Despite the name, this class is an *proof-based* linear algebra class taught at the graduate level.
We emphasize fundamental linear algebra (rank-nullity theorem, eigenvalues, SVD), and applications of linear algebra in data science, including PCA, linear regression, and gradient descent.
Previous experience with basic linear algebra at the undergraduate level is assumed.

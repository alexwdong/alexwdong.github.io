Deep Learning has revolutionized the fields of computer vision and natural language processing.
However, deep learning methods have struggled to perform well on recommender system / information retrieval problems.
One of the main differences between these fields is that recommender system / information retrieval data are much more sparse.
Furthermore, as shown in [Dacrema et al 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06902.pdf), many modern, published, deep learning
models fail to outperform simpler methods (such as linear models or nearest neighbor models).
  
In this project, my team and I implemented MultVAE and word2vec (modified for hotels) on a proprietary information retrieval
dataset from RocketMiles. The RocketMiles dataset was even more sparse than other traditional recommender systems/ information retrieval
datasets (by about 100x more sparse). Our github repository is available [here](https://github.com/EricHe98/sad_final_project), and our
final paper [here](https://github.com/EricHe98/sad_final_project/blob/main/final_report/Learning_to_Rank_Hotels.pdf).

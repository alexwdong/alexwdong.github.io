About Me
======
Hi there! I'm a second year Master's student in Data Science at NYU. 
Before NYU, I worked in the Systems and Analysis group at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, working
on research projects related to aircraft/radar modeling. Even before that, I studied Mathematics at Washington University in St. Louis.

Recently, I've been interested in deep learning applications in computer vision and recommender systems.
In the current semester, I'll be rounding out my deep learning experience with a course in natural language understanding. 
I was also a teaching assistant for the course Optimization and Computational Linear Algebra.
